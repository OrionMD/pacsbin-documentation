# About

## What is Pacsbin?
Pacsbin is a cloud platform for storing, sharing, and viewing anonymized medical
imaging studies for educational and research purposes.

## Why Pacsbin?
Medical imaging uses a special file format for storing images defined in the
[DICOM](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part10.html)
standard. These files often have the extension `.dcm`, or maybe no extension,
and most people's computers cannot open or view them without installing special
software. This makes it difficult for non-technical (or even many technical)
users when all they would like to do is just open and look at an imaging study.

With Pacsbin, you can drag-and-drop DICOM files into the Pacsbin uploader, store
the studies in your cloud account, and view them easily with the built-in image
viewer using any browser, even on your phone! No special software needed.

You can also share studies with others by sending a link, create image based
quizzes, and lots more.
